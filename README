This is an extended version of cl-yacc, that brings syntax for [optionals[], {repeats}, and alternates "|"
You can use these in productions using the following syntax

(:+ ... 'action)   one or more repetitions                                                         
(:* ... 'action)   zero or more repetitions                                                        
(:? ... 'action)   optional - can be present or not                                                
(:or ... 'action)  alternatives. Usual notation is pipe but we can't comfortably use that in lisp. 

To load and test the development version in org syntax.

(asdf::load-system :yacc+)
(asdf:test-system :yacc+)

Or you can use the older sysdef to avoid external dependencies.

(asdf:load-system :yacc)
(compile-file "yacc-tests.lisp")
(load *)
(yacc-tests:tests)

Note that you really must compile yacc-tests.lisp to a file in order to
test the fasdumping machinery.

Documentation is provided in texinfo format in ``cl-yacc.texi'' and in yacc+.org.
You will find a complete example in the file ``calculator.lisp''.
